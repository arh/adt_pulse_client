# ADT-Pulse-Client
ADT-Pulse-Client is a super simple python client for interacting with ADT Pulse alarm system.

Currently this library only supports arming (both away and stay), disarming and getting panel status. 
I wrote this mostly to add alarm support for my personal HomeAssistant set-up, but if there is demand for more functionality I can look into adding it.
